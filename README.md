**Barangay Incident Report System (GoLang)**

Overview

The Barangay Incident Report System is a simple Go-based console application designed to help barangay offices (or schools) record and manage incident reports.
This project not only demonstrates a practical barangay-level solution but also showcases Go’s concurrency features (goroutines and channels).
When an incident report is created, the system:
Saves it locally to reports.txt.
Notifies multiple barangay officers concurrently, simulating real-time acknowledgment.
